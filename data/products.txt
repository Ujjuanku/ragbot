1. AcmeFlow (Enterprise Project Management)

It dynamically adjusts timelines based on team velocity and historical performance data.

**Business Use Cases:**

2. AcmeSecure (Next-Gen Cybersecurity)
**Description:** AcmeSecure is a cloud-native security platform that adopts a "Zero Trust" architecture. It replaces legacy VPNs with identity-aware access proxies.

What sets it apart is "Neural Noise Cancellation," which filters out non-human sounds (like barking dogs or keyboard typing) from calls with 99.8% accuracy. We also offer "HoloMeeting" (Beta), allowing users with AR glasses to project remote colleagues as 3D avatars in their physical space.

**Description:** DataAcme democratizes data analysis. It allows non-technical users to query complex databases using natural language.
