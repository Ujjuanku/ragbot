Acme Tech Solutions: Employee Handbook and HR Policies

At Acme Tech Solutions, we are dedicated to fostering a culture of trust, flexibility, and high performance. This document outlines the core policies that govern our workplace.

1. Work Schedule and Location
**Remote-First Philosophy:** We trust our employees to work where they are most productive. We operate on a "Remote-First" model, meaning all processes are designed for distributed teams.
**Working Hours:** While usage of hours is flexible, we require "Core Collaboration Hours" between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM in your local time zone (or the time zone of your primary team) to ensure synchronous collaboration is possible.
**Async Week:** The last week of every quarter is designated as an "Async Week," where all synchronous meetings are cancelled to allow for deep work and project completion.

2. Leave and Time Off
**Unlimited PTO:** We offer an open Paid Time Off (PTO) policy. We do not cap the number of vacation days. However, to prevent burnout, we *require* a minimum of 15 days off per year.
**Sick Leave:** Employees separate from PTO, employees are entitled to 10 days of paid sick leave annually.
**Parental Leave:** We offer industry-leading parental leave: 20 weeks of fully paid leave for birth mothers and 16 weeks for fathers and adoptive parents. Re-entry coaching is provided upon return.
**Bereavement:** Up to 10 days of paid leave for the loss of an immediate family member.

3. Complete Benefits Package
**Health Insurance:** Acme Tech covers 100% of medical, dental, and vision premiums for employees and 75% for their dependents.
**Retirement:** We provide a 401(k) matching program, matching 50% of employee contributions up to 6% of their annual salary.
**Wellness Stipend:** A monthly allowance of $150 is provided for gym memberships, therapy, meditation apps, or fitness equipment.
**Home Office Budget:** New hires receive a one-time $1,000 stipend to set up their remote workspace, plus $500 annually for upgrades.

4. Performance and Growth
**Review Cycle:** Performance reviews are conducted bi-annually in June and December. We utilize a 360-degree feedback mechanism where you receive input from peers, subordinates, and managers.
**Promotion Windows:** Promotions are announced in January and July.
**Learning & Development:** Every employee has an annual L&D budget of $2,500. This can be used for conferences, certifications, books, or online courses related to their field.

5. Code of Conduct
**Inclusivity:** We have zero tolerance for discrimination based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or age.
**Harassment:** All forms of harassment are strictly prohibited. We maintain an anonymous whistleblower hotline managed by a third-party legal firm to report violations safely.
**Information Security:** All employees must complete annual security training. Sharing proprietary code or customer data on unauthorized public platforms (like personal GitHub repos) is grounds for immediate termination.

6. Onboarding Process
**Day 1:** IT Setup and Welcome-All-Hands meeting.
**Week 1:** "Acme Academy" - A series of workshops on company history, product deep-dives, and culture.
**Month 1:** Pair programming (for engineers) or shadowing (for business roles) with a dedicated "Buddy" mentor.
**Day 90:** A check-in with the manager to assess role fit and set long-term OKRs (Objectives and Key Results).
